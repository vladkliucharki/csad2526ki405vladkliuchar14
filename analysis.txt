## Cross-Platform Build & Test Analysis
Linux (Ubuntu)
The build process on Ubuntu completed without any compilation errors. The cmake --build . command successfully generated the HelloWorld executable in the designated build directory. All unit tests, executed via CTest, passed, confirming that the BasicAddition test case is functional. The build log showed minor, non-critical warnings related to FetchContent timestamps, which had no impact on the outcome.

Windows
On the Windows platform, the build succeeded using the Visual Studio generator. The HelloWorld.exe executable and its GoogleTest dependencies were correctly produced inside the build/Debug directory. The BasicAddition test case within the UnitTests suite passed when executed with ctest. Similar to the Linux build, warnings related to FetchContent were observed but did not impede the process.

macOS
The build on macOS, utilizing the AppleClang compiler, also completed successfully for all targets. The HelloWorld executable was generated as expected. The test suite passed entirely. A non-critical linker warning about a duplicate library (libgtest.a) was noted in the log, but it did not cause the build to fail.

## Overall Summary
Universal Success: The CI workflow demonstrates that the project builds and tests successfully across all three major operating systems.

Artifact Generation: The primary executable (HelloWorld/HelloWorld.exe) was generated correctly on each platform.

Test Consistency: The Google Test suite, run via CTest, passed consistently in all environments.

Identified Issue: The ci.sh script failed on macOS due to a shebang error (No such file or directory). This is a known issue caused by a Byte Order Mark (BOM) character in the script file, which needs to be removed for the script to be executable. The ci.bat script functions as intended on Windows.
